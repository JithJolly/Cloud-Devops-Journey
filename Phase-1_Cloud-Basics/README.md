## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a platform where users don’t need to manage physical infrastructure like servers or data centers. Instead, they can just focus on running their applications, software, or business logic.

All the technical requirements — such as storage, networking, hardware, and maintenance — are handled by cloud service providers (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).

✅ In simple terms:
You rent computing power and services over the internet, and the cloud provider takes care of the rest.

### ✅ Benefits:
- ✔ No need for physical servers
- ✔ Pay-as-you-go (cheaper)
- ✔ Scalable (grow/shrink as needed)
- ✔ Accessible from anywhere

### ❌ Drawbacks:
- ✗ Requires internet
- ✗ Security concerns (if not configured properly)

## 🛠️ IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

| **Feature**    | **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**       | **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**                    | **SaaS (Software as a Service)**        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Rent servers, storage, networking             | Ready-made platform to build & deploy apps          | Use ready-made software                  |
| **Control**    | Full control over OS & applications           | Control over your app code, not infrastructure      | No control — just use the software       |
| **Maintenance**| You manage the infrastructure                 | Provider manages servers and runtime                | Provider manages everything               |
| **Examples**   | AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine                | Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine    | Gmail, Zoom, Dropbox                      |

✅ **Quick Summary**:

- **IaaS** → You manage everything except the hardware.  
- **PaaS** → You write code; the provider runs it for you.  
- **SaaS** → You just use the app; no setup required.

## 📊 What is AWS?

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is the world’s most popular cloud computing platform.

### 🔹 Key AWS Services:
- **EC2** → Virtual servers
- **S3** → File storage
- **RDS** → Databases
- **Lambda** → Serverless computing

### 🔹 Why AWS?
- ✔ Largest cloud provider
- ✔ Free tier for beginners
- ✔ Used by companies like Netflix, Airbnb, NASA
